# 🚀 CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a CPU scheduling simulator designed and implemented as a university project for the Operating Systems course.

## 📋 Project Features

- Implementation of various CPU scheduling algorithms
- Graphical User Interface using WPF
- Gantt chart visualization for processes
- Calculation of average turnaround and waiting times

## 🛠️ Implemented Algorithms

- **FCFS (First Come First Served)**
  - Scheduling based on process arrival order
  - Simplest scheduling algorithm

- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
  - Scheduling based on shortest execution time
  - Optimal average waiting time

## 🎨 User Interface

- Process input table
- Scheduling results table
- Gantt chart for visual scheduling representation
- Display of average turnaround and waiting times

## 🚀 How to Run

### Method 1: Using Visual Studio
1. Open the project in Visual Studio
2. Build the project
3. Run the application

### Method 2: Using Shortcut
1. Double-click on the `CpuScheduling` shortcut on your desktop
2. The application will start automatically

### Using the Application
1. Enter processes with the following specifications:
   - Process name
   - Arrival time
   - Burst time
2. Select the desired algorithm
3. View the results

## 📊 Outputs

- Start and finish time for each process
- Turnaround time for each process
- Waiting time for each process
- Average turnaround and waiting times
- Gantt chart for visual scheduling representation
